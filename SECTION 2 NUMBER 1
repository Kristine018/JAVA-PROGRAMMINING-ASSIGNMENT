//This Java program collects a user's surname and current age, then performs two simple computations. It calculates the length of the surname and checks whether the age is even or odd.

import java.util.Scanner;

public class UserInfo {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // We need a way to read input from the user, so let's create a Scanner object.
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // First, we ask the user to enter their surname.
        System.out.print("Enter your surname: ");
        String surname = scanner.nextLine();  // We read the surname input from the user.

        // Next, we ask the user for their current age.
        System.out.print("Enter your current age: ");
        int age = scanner.nextInt();  // We read the age input as an integer.

        // Now we calculate the number of characters in the surname.
        int surnameLength = surname.length();  // This gives us the length of the surname.

        // Let's determine if the age is even or odd.
        String ageType = (age % 2 == 0) ? "even" : "odd";  // We use a conditional operator for this.

        // Now, we print the results to the console.
        System.out.println("The number of characters is " + surnameLength + ".");  // Output the surname length.
        System.out.println("Your current age is an " + ageType + " number.");  // Output whether the age is even or odd.

        //  close the Scanner .
        scanner.close();
    }
