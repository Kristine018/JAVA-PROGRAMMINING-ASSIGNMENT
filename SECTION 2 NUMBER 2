// This Java program calculates and displays the average of marks entered by a student for five different units. It uses a Scanner to collect the marks from the user, stores them in an array, calculates the total, computes the average, and then prints the average rounded to two decimal places

import java.util.Scanner;

public class StudentMarks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // We need a way to read input from the user, so let's create a Scanner object.
        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);

        // We'll use an array to store the marks for 5 different units.
        double[] marks = new double[5];
        double total = 0.0;  // This will hold the total of all marks entered.

        // Now, let's prompt the user to enter the marks for each unit.
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            // We ask for marks for each unit and store them in the array.
            System.out.print("Enter the marks for unit " + (i + 1) + ": ");

            total += marks[i];  // Add the entered marks to the total.
        }

        // After gathering all the marks, we calculate the average.
        double average = total / 5;  // Divide the total by the number of units (5).

        // Finally, we display the average, formatting it to two decimal places.
