//This java program counts whether the integer entered by the user tends to be divided by any number ranging from 1 to 9. This one first asks an integer from the user and then there is a loop which checks for divisibility of all the numbers in the given range. It has particular rules to recognize the aliquot by 2 and 5 (the last digit of the number equals 0 or 5, respectively) and it prints appropriate messages if the function coincides with one of the conditions.
